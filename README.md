## Branches üåø

* **`main`:** The stable version *without* Gemini integration.
* **`gemini`:** The development branch *with* the Google Gemini analysis feature integrated. **Checkout this branch if you want to test the Gemini analysis.**

## Build and Run üöÄ

**Important:** Make sure you are on the `gemini` branch if you want to use the Gemini analysis feature.

1.  **Checkout the branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout gemini
    ```
2.  **Build:** Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This will compile the code and create an executable `.jar` file in the `target/` directory.

3.  **Run:**
    * **Option 1 (From Jar file):** Ensure the `config.properties` file is in the same directory as the jar file.
        ```bash
        java -jar target/website-monitoring-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
        ```
        *(The jar file name might be slightly different depending on your `pom.xml` configuration)*
    * **Option 2 (Via Maven):** Run directly from source code (place `config.properties` in the project root).
        ```bash
        mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="websitemonitoring.Main"
        ```
